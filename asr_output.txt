121-127105-0000.flac	 It was this observation that drew from Douglas, not immediately but later in the evening, a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention.
121-127105-0001.flac	 Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121-127105-0002.flac	 cried one of the women. He took no notice of her. He looked at me, but as if instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121-127105-0003.flac	 There was a unanimous groan at this, and much for proche. After which in his preoccupied way he explained,
121-127105-0004.flac	 The story's written.
121-127105-0005.flac	 I could write to my man and enclose the key. He could send down the packet as he finds it.
121-127105-0006.flac	 The others resented postponement, but it was just his groupels that charmed me.
121-127105-0007.flac	 To this his answer was prompt. Oh, thank God no. And is the record yours?
121-127105-0008.flac	 He hung fire again, a woman's.
121-127105-0009.flac	 She has been dead these 20 years.
121-127105-0010.flac	 She sent me the pages in question before she died.
121-127105-0011.flac	 She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position. She would have been worthy of any whatever.
121-127105-0012.flac	 It wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn't. I was sure I could see.
121-127105-0013.flac	 You'll easily judge why when you hear, because the thing had been such a scare? He continued to fix me.
121-127105-0014.flac	 You are acute.
121-127105-0015.flac	 He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.
121-127105-0016.flac	 Probably not till the second post.
121-127105-0017.flac	 It was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay.
121-127105-0018.flac	 Cry the ladies whose departure had been fixed.
121-127105-0019.flac	 This is Griffin however, express the need for a little more light.
121-127105-0020.flac	 Who was it she was in love with? The story will tell. I took upon myself to reply. Oh, I can't wait for the story. The story won't tell," said Douglas. Not in any literal vulgar way. More is the pity then.
121-127105-0021.flac	 Won't you tell Douglas?
121-127105-0022.flac	 Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who he was.
121-127105-0023.flac	 Let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what I shall presently give.
121-127105-0024.flac	 Poor Douglas, before his death, when it was in sight, committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth.
121-127105-0025.flac	 The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't, of course, thank heaven, stay, they departed in consequence of arrangements made. In a rage of curiosity as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up.
121-127105-0026.flac	 The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tail at a point after it had, in a manner begun.
121-127105-0027.flac	 He had for his own town residents a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase, but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex that he wished to immediately to proceed.
121-127105-0028.flac	 The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations, and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121-127105-0029.flac	 There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as this government would be in supreme authority.
121-127105-0030.flac	 I don't anticipate.
121-127105-0031.flac	 She was young, untried, nervous. It was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness.
121-127105-0032.flac	 Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion.
121-127105-0033.flac	 It was the beauty of it.
121-127105-0034.flac	 It sounded dull, that sounded strange, and all the more so because of his main condition, which was...
121-127105-0035.flac	 She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disperdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice. She already felt rewarded.
121-127105-0036.flac	 But was that all her reward? One of the ladies asked.
