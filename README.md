# Automatic-Speech-Recognition
This project focuses on Speech Recognition, also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) — a key technology that transforms spoken language into written text. ASR bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding, powering applications such as:
- 🧠 Virtual assistants
- 📝 Real-time transcription
- 🎙️ Voice-controlled interfaces

🔍 How It Works
- The ASR system processes audio signals by:
- Extracting acoustic features (e.g., spectrograms)
- Using AI-based models (deep learning) to decode speech into text
- Integrating with NLP for downstream understanding and response

🧠 Tech Stack & Highlights
- Audio preprocessing and feature extraction
- Deep learning models for sequence decoding
- Integration with NLP for enhanced interaction

This project demonstrates the fundamental pipeline of ASR and explores its potential in building intelligent, speech-enabled applications.
